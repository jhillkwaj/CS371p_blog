<b>What did you do this past week?</b>
We had our first exam this week. In addition to that we read a paper on Th Liskov Substitution Principle which involves allowing constructs that take in an instance of a class to also take in a instance of a child of that class. In class we went over an example of how to write a range iterator and outside of class we wen to a talk where two people from Mutual Mobile talked about some of the challenges of mobile development and how to employ proper design principles to allow for apps to evolve over time.

<b>What's in your way?</b>
I didn't do badly of the test but I didn't do quite as well as I would have liked. I need to do a better job keeping up with material to do well on the quizzes and make studying for the next exam easier. This week I have an exam, I have to grade a 312 assignment, and I have a cyberphysical systems project due. I also need to find time to study for the oop quizzes to get my quiz average up though and maybe go ahead and look at the next project when it is released.

<b>What will you do next week?</b>
For oop I will read a paper on Th eInterface Segregation Principle and hopefully study for the quizzes and learn about what the next assignment is and what we will be covering in the second half of the course. In my other classes I have a chem exam Tuesday Night which I need to spend more time studying for since I didn't do quite as well as I needed to on the first one. I have a project due in cyberphysical systems where we have to write a simulator to balance an inverted pendulum. I have to grade a 312 assignment and figure out what I am talking about during the next discussion section. Finally I have echo practice Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

<b>What's my experience of the class?</b>
The Mutual Mobile talk was interesting. Overall I feel like I have learned a lot in this course so far. I didn't know much C++ going into this class but now I feel confident with it. The exam was not what I expected. I was anticipating it to be less conceptual and involve writing code since that is what other people said it would be like. I probably would have studied differently if I had know what it would be like and maybe I would have done better. I'm not really sure what I got wrong but the L and R value questions tripped me up since I wasn't really expecting anything like that, much less 4 or 5 questions.

<b>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</b>
Earlier this week there was a major AWS outage that affected thousands of websites. Only a month prior GibLab experienced a major outage. Both of these were caused by errors by employees that would have been preventable with additional safeguards. I highly recored reading both GitLab's postmortem of and Amazon's statement on what happened to learn about some of the dangers of working on large production servers. https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/10/postmortem-of-database-outage-of-january-31/    https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/
